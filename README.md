The Hospital Management System in Java manages doctors, patients, medicines, laboratories, hospital facilities, and staff. The main method initializes arrays for storing data and pre-populates them with sample entries. The system presents a main menu allowing users to navigate and manage different sections. Each section (Doctor, Patient, Medicine, Laboratory, Facility, Staff) has options to add new entries and display existing ones. User inputs drive navigation through the menu, and actions are performed accordingly. The program handles exceptions with a try-catch block, ensuring robustness. This system provides a foundational framework for comprehensive hospital management.
